# MIPS-Design-MEM-
MIPS Data Memory/Write Back (MEM/WB) implementation including Verilog, MIPS and Testbench
>Using Verilog, develop the Data Memory (DM) and Write Back (WB) stages of the MIPS pipeline. This will include development of the data memory and other related components. You will use the Fibonacci machine code for testing this stage. You will need to develop supporting hardware and software to test the operation of this stage, including:
1. MEM/WB – data memory (DM) and WB MUX
a. read/write data from/to DM
b. Control WB – from DataMemory
Components: Data memory, WB mux
Control signals: MemRead, MemWrite, MemtoReg
